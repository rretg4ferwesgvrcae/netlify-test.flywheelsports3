										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First came the boom of boutique fitness classes; then came the influx of at-home boutique fitness experiences. While these trends offer effective, personalized workouts, the one problem is that they often come with high price tags. If you&#8217;re moving toward the at-home offerings, first you need to stock up on the right gear, buy a streaming package or a membership plan, and then inevitably tack on a few extras (i.e. in-home set-up) that sound too appealing to forgo. (You could consider downloading one of these best workout apps for a workout you can do with little more than your phone.)</p>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-1" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></div>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-2" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But now, Flywheel Sports, the fitness company known for indoor cycling and barre classes as well as, more recently, at-home class streaming, is offering a huge discount on its Home Bike for a limited time only. Translation: You can finally invest in the at-home fitness equipment you&#8217;ve been wanting, without the sticker shock.</p>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-3" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></div>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-4" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Flywheel Home bike is heavily marked down now through January 9 at 3 am EST, thanks to Amazon&#8217;s Deal of the Day. For 24 hours only, you can get the Flywheel Home bike for just $999—which is more than 40 percent off—or $1,299 (down from $1,999) if you opt for the bike <em>with</em> the built-in tablet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of Peloton&#8217;s biggest competitors, Flywheel Sports, announced today that it is shutting down its online classes. The company sent an email informing its users that it would stop its Flywheel At Home service effective March 27th 2020. The bikes can still be used of course, but without the live and on-demand coaching, which makes them not much better than ordinary stationary bikes. Peloton, however, is offering a deal where Flywheel customers can turn in their bikes in exchange for a &#8220;like-new&#8221; Peloton bike at no cost to them, though they&#8217;d still have to pay Peloton&#8217;s monthly subscription fee.</p>
<h2>This comes just two weeks after Flywheel Sports settled a patent infringement dispute with Peloton.</h2>
<p>Flywheel admitted that it copied Peloton&#8217;s technology, such as the leaderboard display where you could compare your stats to other riders during the class. In the settlement, Flywheel Sports had agreed to stop using the leaderboard system for 60 days, at which point Peloton would drop its case. Of course, now that&#8217;s moot since the service will go entirely.</p>
<p>Flywheel Sports is not the only competitor that Peloton has sued. Last year, Peloton filed a suit against Echelon Fitness LLC for broadcasting live and recorded cycling classes and &#8220;imitating the Peloton Bike experience&#8221; through a similar leaderboard interface. Echelon also accuse of copying Peloton&#8217;s logo, coloring and font, and for lying to its customers about Peloton&#8217;s offerings. That lawsuit is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Peloton has other rivals too, such as the NordicTrack Commercial S22i and Proform&#8217;s Studio Bike Pro, both of which offer streaming cycling classes with their bikes. At CES this year, we saw several other companies that could prove to be worthy Peloton rivals, such as the aforementioned Echelon and the Amazfit Home Studio. But Peloton&#8217;s biggest rival may have yet to come, as Equinox and SoulCycle announced recently that they would be offering a similar in-home workout solution with their own treadmills and bicycles in early 2020.</p>
<h2>Last year, Peloton faced a string of bad press when a controversial ad that criticize as &#8220;unintentionally terrifying&#8221; went viral.</h2>
<p>It embroil in a music licensing dispute with the NMPA, and its shares also dropped 11 percent after it opened below its IPO price on its first day of trading. Add shareholder pressure to all of the aforementioned competition, and it&#8217;s not surprising that Peloton might be more compelled than ever to protect its intellectual property.</p>
<p>While Flywheel Sports have discontinued its online service, several of its in-person cycling studios continue to operate.</p>

<p>New York Sports Clubs-owner Town Sports International has agreed to buy part of Flywheel Sports, the boutique spin studio operator and maker of at-home cycling equipment, according to multiple people briefed on the matter. Town Sports is set to take over the dozens of studios Flywheel owns with plans to launch a premium offering that would give its hundreds of thousands of members access to classes at the studio chain known for its high-intensity spin cycle classes, the people said. An announcement could be made as early as next week.</p>
<p>The deal will not include Flywheel’s at-home cycling business, which makes a rival bike to one popularised by Peloton that retails for more than $1,699. Flywheel’s owner, the investment group Kennedy Lewis, is in talks with other buyers for that unit, although it may end up retaining the business if it cannot reach an agreement.  Kennedy Lewis will take a roughly 15 per cent stake in Town Sports as part of the deal and the investment group may help finance future acquisitions for the fitness chain operator, the people said.</p>
<p>The transaction follows a difficult period for both Flywheel and Town Sports. Investors have pumped billions of dollars into the fitness industry over the past few years, bankrolling dozens of new boutique gym concepts as well as makers of at-home fitness equipment such as Peloton and Mirror as consumers spend substantial sums on health and wellness.  That competition has weighed on established fitness companies including Flywheel and Town Sports, as well as once darlings of the industry such as SoulCycle, which ultimately pulled its plans for an initial public offering. Slowing growth and operational problems weighed on the company’s sales prospects, and Flywheel ultimately accepted a capital injection from Kennedy Lewis that gave the investment group control of the business.</p>
<p>Under Kennedy Lewis, Flywheel has closed underperforming locations in a bid to improve its finances. The group has also worked with boutique investment bank Houlihan Lokey to explore strategic options.</p>
<p>Mr Richman was a senior managing director within Blackstone&#8217;s credit arm GSO Capital before leaving to start Kennedy Lewis.  While Town Sports reported rising revenues last year, its losses have climbed and its cash pile has dwindled. In November it warned its investors that it did not have enough cash on hand to repay debts coming due later this year if it is unable to refinance those obligations. Shares in Town Sports, which operates 187 gyms and counts 630,000 members, have tumbled 88 per cent from an all-time high hit in 2018. On Friday stock in the indebted group closed at $1.78 each, valuing Town Sports’ equity at roughly $50m.</p>
<p>Those shares were up almost 30 per cent in after-hours trading on Friday after Town Sports chairman and chief executive Patrick Walsh disclosed to US securities regulators that he had purchased millions of more shares in the company, lifting his stake in the group to 29.6 per cent. Kennedy Lewis and Houlihan Lokey declined to comment. Town Sports and Flywheel did not respond to request for comment. Bloomberg news agency earlier reported that Flywheel and Town Sports were nearing a deal.</p>

Flywheel hasn’t returned requests for comment, but some of its current and former instructors posted on social media that the company had gone under.</p>
<p class="paragraph inline-placeholder" data-uri="archive.cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_98BD2FCC-A760-779B-B3AC-92014BD180D5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-analytics-observe="off">At its peak, the 10-year-old company had more than 40 studios across the United States that offered cycling and barre classes. But Flywheel was having troubles well before the pandemic hit.</p>

The decision made Flywheel’s at-home bikes unusable, with Peloton offering its own bikes to Flywheel’s customers.</p>
<p class="paragraph inline-placeholder" data-uri="archive.cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_3B9333FB-3D12-3F39-444D-9254E0AC348F@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-analytics-observe="off">In summer 2019, Flywheel permanently closed about a dozen of its studios. And in February 2020, Flywheel was forced to shut down the virtual classes that were connected to its in-home stationary bikes because of the two-year legal battle with Peloton over patent infringement.</p>
<p class="paragraph inline-placeholder" data-uri="archive.cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_C0F1A035-F62C-0E53-1EE7-9218F0F76FD0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-analytics-observe="off">Weeks later, the pandemic stuck and forced Flywheel to temporarily close all its studios. The company reportedly laid off 98% of its 1,200-person staff. Flywheel had recently begun offering classes in two cities (Hamptons, New York and Miami, Florida), but those are no longer bookable, according to its website.</p>
<p class="paragraph inline-placeholder" data-uri="archive.cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_E377EA7D-8B49-4DF2-47AE-921FFA8E21B5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-analytics-observe="off">The newly bankrupt Town Sports International (owner of New York Sports Club and other chains), dropped its plans in April to buy Flywheel after reaching an agreement just four months prior.</p>

Meanwhile, Peloton has found success and reported blockbuster earnings last week. SoulCycle has reopened dozens of studios and has begun selling its $2,500 in-home bike.</p>
