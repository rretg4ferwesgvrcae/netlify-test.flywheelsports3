										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First came the boom of boutique fitness classes; then came the influx of at-home boutique fitness experiences. While these trends offer effective, personalized workouts, the one problem is that they often come with high price tags. If you&#8217;re moving toward the at-home offerings, first you need to stock up on the right gear, buy a streaming package or a membership plan, and then inevitably tack on a few extras (i.e. in-home set-up) that sound too appealing to forgo. (You could consider downloading one of these best workout apps for a workout you can do with little more than your phone.)</p>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-1" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></div>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-2" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But now, Flywheel Sports, the fitness company known for indoor cycling and barre classes as well as, more recently, at-home class streaming, is offering a huge discount on its Home Bike for a limited time only. Translation: You can finally invest in the at-home fitness equipment you&#8217;ve been wanting, without the sticker shock.</p>
<div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-3" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></div>
<p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-4" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Flywheel Home bike is heavily marked down now through January 9 at 3 am EST, thanks to Amazon&#8217;s Deal of the Day. For 24 hours only, you can get the Flywheel Home bike for just $999—which is more than 40 percent off—or $1,299 (down from $1,999) if you opt for the bike <em>with</em> the built-in tablet.</p>
