										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="xn-location">NEW YORK</span>, <span class="xn-chron">Feb. 4, 2020</span> /PRNewswire/ &#8212; Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON), the world&#8217;s largest interactive fitness platform, today announced that it has settled its patent infringement litigation against Flywheel Sports, Inc.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very excited to have registered a massive win in our fight to protect Peloton&#8217;s intellectual property. This result reinforces the strength of our patent portfolio and reaffirms our lead as an innovation company operating at the intersection of fitness, technology and content,&#8221; said <span class="xn-person">Hisao Kushi</span>, Chief Legal Officer and Co-Founder of Peloton.</p>
<h2>In 2018 and 2019, Peloton initiated patent infringement suits against Flywheel related to its Fly Anywhere bike for infringing on Peloton&#8217;s patented technology. Today, Peloton officially issued the following statement:</h2>
<p>&#8220;Peloton Interactive, Inc. is pleased to announce that it has settled its patent infringement litigation against Flywheel Sports, Inc. As a condition of the settlement, Flywheel has agreed to immediately cease its use of Peloton&#8217;s patented technology, and Peloton has agreed to dismiss its litigation against Flywheel. Flywheel, likewise, has terminated its proceedings against Peloton at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peloton was represented in the litigation by <span class="xn-person">Steven Feldman</span> of Hueston Hennigan LLP.</p>
<p>The cases are <i>Peloton Interactive Inc. v. Flywheel Sports Inc</i>., Nos. 2:18-cv-00390 and 2:19-CV-00317, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of <span class="xn-location">Texas</span>.</p>
